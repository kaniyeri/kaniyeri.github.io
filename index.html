Hi, I am Nikhil Kaniyeri, a senior in the Electrical Engineering Department at IIT Bombay. My research interests include Computer Architecture, Hardware Security and Acceleration.

<span style="color: chartreuse;">What am I reading right now?</span>: <span style="color:yellow"> <a href="https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Fuzzing_Against_the_Machine.html">Fuzzing Against the Machine</a></span> - Fuzzing is the technique of automatically finding vulnerabilities in a program by trying various inputs. This book explains fuzzing with a focus on architecture for IoT, practically. <hr>
<span style="color: chartreuse;">What am I tinkering with right now?</span>: Intel's heterogeneous cores have different <a href="https://github.com/kaniyeri/msr-reference/">MSRs</a> per type of core (<b>p</b>erformance and <b>e</b>fficiency). Managed to make it run specifically on each type of core with a little stressing and scheduling tricks. Currently begging skeptical friends to run the kernel level scanner for reference data. Post soon.
